# Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
Starter files and fully functioning finished sample code for my Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect course, currently targeting .NET 8 and .NET 9.

- The **main** branch targets .NET 8 and exactly matches the course.
- The **net9** branch targets .NET 9.
- The **net10** branch targets .NET 10, and is currently a copy of the **latest-and-greatest** branch.. 
- The **latest-and-greatest** branch  targets .NET 10, and potentially contains changes that were incorporated after recording. Most often these changes are language features that are relatively new and/or in preview and that will probably make it into the main branch when course updates happen. If you don't want to wait for that you can already check it out - enjoy :-)
