# Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect
Starter files and fully functioning finished sample code for my Securing ASP.NET Core with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect course, currently targeting .NET 8 and .NET 9.

- The **main** branch targets .NET 8 and exactly matches the course.
- The **net9** branch targets .NET 9. 
- The **latest-and-greatest** branch also targets .NET 9, and contains changes that were incorporated after recording. Most often these changes are language features that are relatively new and/or in preview, like primary constructors, switch expressions and so on. Most of these changes will probably make it into the main branch when course updates happen, but if you don't want to wait for that you can already check it out - enjoy :-)
